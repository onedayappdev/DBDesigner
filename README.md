Database designer plugin for phpPgAdmin
=======================================

Installation
------------

1. You need a copy of the latest phpPgAdmin version on github. (Tested and working with: https://github.com/FranLMSP/phppgadmin.git)

2. Place this plugin as a subfolder of the directory `plugins/` (The name "DBDesigner" must be preserved).

3. Go to the file `sql/erdiagrams-pgsql` and run the sql commands to create a the database responsible for storing the ER Diagrams.

4. Enable the plugin by adding and entry in the phpPgAdmin's file `conf/config.inc.php`. It should look something like this: `$conf['plugins'] = array('DBDesigner')`;

5. Navigate to the schema where you want to create the ER Diagram and you're done!.
